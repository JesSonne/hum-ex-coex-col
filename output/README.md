## Simulation results for each future climate scenario RCP 4.5 ('mid-range') & 8.5 (‘worst-case’) scenario

All files are structured as data matrices with 84 rows (number of hummingbird-plant networks) and 32 columns (number of general circulation models (GCMs), i.e. future climate estimates). Entries show the means from 1000 simulation repetitions. 

**Climate_driven_extinctions:**  Proportion of Climate-driven extinctions for each community and GCM

**Coextinctions:**  Proportion of Climate-driven extinctions + coextinctions for each community and GCM

**Coextinctions with rewiring:**  Proportion of Climate-driven extinctions + coextinctions for each community and GCM. After each extinction event, species were allowed to relocate 50% of their lost interactions with remaining species in the network

**Colonizations_100km:** Ratio of the number of colonizing hummingbird species to the number of species in the source pool. Here, the source pool was defined as a 100km radius surrounding each community

**Colonizations_10km:** Ratio of the number of colonizing hummingbird species to the number of species in the source pool. Here, the source pool was defined as a 10km radius surrounding each community

**Lost species strength:** Cumulative loss in species strength from climate-driven extinction. 

**Lost effective partner number:** Cumulative loss in effective partner number from climate-driven extinction.
